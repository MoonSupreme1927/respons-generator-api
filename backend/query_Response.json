When making real-time decisions using the API, we would recommend using 90+ as the threshold for high confidence decisions when blocking or penalizing a user based on the Fraud Score. You can also use 85+ as a threshold on the API, but we recommend starting with 90+ and then adjusting the score from there based on the results you are seeing."
